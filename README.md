# Leaderboard

> The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score.

Below you can see how this website should look and behave:

## Live Demo

[Live Demo](https://sediqullahbadakhsh.github.io/leaderboard/)

### Interaction with the Leaderboard API

- First, add the base url
- Create a new game. The POST method is used to create a new game and the game must have a name e.g { "name": "My cool new game" } Each created game has a result in the form of a unique ID or key called the gameId
- There are two allowed actions to access the scores, the POST and GET methods
- POST method creates a new score for the given game and it requires that a username and point is first given
- GET method however does not require any input from the user and its function is just to return the list of users and their scores
- Get the gameID then chain it with the base url to get the score.
